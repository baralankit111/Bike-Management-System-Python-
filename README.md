# Bike-Management-System-Python-

  Introduction: 
 
This project is to create a Bike management system which mainly functions to manage sell and addStock of bike from a Motorbike dealer. The Motorbike dealer system keeps record of available bikes, bikes which are  purchase  by the users and bike which is sell by the users. Also, in each activity by the user, a suitable message is displayed.   Meanwhile, in this contemporary world we can witness how the new technologies has brought up changes for the methods and techniques surpassing the old methods. This system will help the Motorbike dealer to experience the easy method to keep the records of their daily activities of Purchase and Adding Stock conveniently without any errors. This system is time-efficient and easy to use for all the Motorbike dealer activities involved in it.

                                           Figure  How Python Interpreater Works. 

Firstly, the Bike management system allows the user to view the bike available to Purchase then the user moves to the step of purchasing bike according to their choice. After selling, the record related to the user and bike is kept safely in the file.  
Also, if the user wants to sell the bike(addingStock), the Bike management system handles it precisely. Alike bike sells, the system keeps the record of addingStock by the user in a file. For each transaction of bike selled and added, the bike database is updated accordingly. Also, this system handles all the wrong inputs given by the users continuing the flow of program. For the wrong inputs the system suggests the users to give valid inputs so that the program will run accordingly.
