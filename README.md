# Bike-Management-System-Python-

  Introduction: 
 
This project is to create a Bike management system which mainly functions to manage sell and addStock of bike from a Motorbike dealer. The Motorbike dealer system keeps record of available bikes, bikes which are  purchase  by the users and bike which is sell by the users. Also, in each activity by the user, a suitable message is displayed.   Meanwhile, in this contemporary world we can witness how the new technologies has brought up changes for the methods and techniques surpassing the old methods. This system will help the Motorbike dealer to experience the easy method to keep the records of their daily activities of Purchase and Adding Stock conveniently without any errors. This system is time-efficient and easy to use for all the Motorbike dealer activities involved in it.

                                           Figure  How Python Interpreater Works. 

Firstly, the Bike management system allows the user to view the bike available to Purchase then the user moves to the step of purchasing bike according to their choice. After selling, the record related to the user and bike is kept safely in the file.  
Also, if the user wants to sell the bike(addingStock), the Bike management system handles it precisely. Alike bike sells, the system keeps the record of addingStock by the user in a file. For each transaction of bike selled and added, the bike database is updated accordingly. Also, this system handles all the wrong inputs given by the users continuing the flow of program. For the wrong inputs the system suggests the users to give valid inputs so that the program will run accordingly.

Algorithm: 

Step 1: Start Program  
Step 2: Set the while loop True  
Step 3: Take the user input for option to display, sell, addStock and exit.  
Step 4: From Step 3, If user input to display, display all the bike available to sell 
          . Then go to Step 5  
Step 5: Go to Step 3  
Step 6: From Step 3, If user input is to sell  
Input the first name and last name of the user.  
             Create text file for sell and store all the bike details.  
Step 7: Choose the option of the bike to purchase.  
Step 8: Check if the bike is available  
If the chosen bike is available, add the details of bike in the sell text file  
             After selling, go to Step 9  
             If the chosen bike is not available, display suitable message for   unavailability of the bike. Then go to Step 7.  
Step 9: Decrease the quantity of selling bike in the Bike file.  
Step 10: If user wants to buy more bike. Ask user for Yes or No  
               If Yes, go to Step 7  
               If No, go to Step 11  
Step 11: Go to Step 3  
Step 12: From Step 3, if user input is to return. Then go to, Step 13 
Step 13: Input the name of the seller.  
Step 14: Check if the name is valid or not.  
               If name is valid, read the sell text file of given seller name. Then                go to Step 15.  
               If name is not valid, go to Step 13.  
Step 15: Display the sellbike text file of given seller name and create a addStock text                file of that seller. Also, increase the quantity of adding bike in Bikes file.  
Step 16: Check if the bike is adding or not. 
             If Yes, add then increase the quantity of bikes Then, go to Step 17  
             If No, go to Step 17  
Step 17: Add the Total quantity of bikes in the addingStock text file. Then go to Step 
18.  
Step 18: Go to Step 3.  
Step 19: From Step 3. If user input is to exit. Exit the program by breaking the loop.  
 
 Planning to have a Bike management system for motorbike dealer but at the same time, you are not sure whether the resources that you have are enough. What will you do? You will define a work plan that will ensure you spend the little resources available to finish the Bike management system that is an Algorithm.
